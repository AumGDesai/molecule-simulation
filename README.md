# 3D Molecular Simulator using Zelle Graphics and Tkinter GUI

**Special thanks to Andrew Lipton for his invaluable help and guidance throughout this project.**

---

## Project Overview

This project enhances the Zelle graphics library by transforming its native 2D capabilities into a simulated 3D environment designed for molecular visualization. Users can input atomic numbers through a user-friendly Tkinter GUI to create and explore various molecules interactively in 3D space.

The main features include:

- **3D simulation** built on top of the classic 2D Zelle graphics library.
- **Interactive molecule construction** by entering atomic numbers.
- **Tkinter GUI** for easy molecule input and control.
- Real-time **visual exploration** of molecular structures.
